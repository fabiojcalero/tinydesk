## Target User:

An individual user who wants to increase his browser workflow productivity. It can be a student or a professional who wishes to organize bookmarks and personalize their browser homepage.

## Problem Statement:

Internet browsers have very limited options for managing and organizing bookmarks. When the user adds bookmarks, they usually appear unorganized and spread without any meaningful layout.

## Solution:

Our solution is to create a webpage that serves as a startup page on an internet browser. We chose Google Chrome for this project. This webpage will allow users to manage their bookmarks by categorizing them into folders. The webpage will also contain widgets for notes, to-do lists, weather, and calendar. Users need to sign up to enjoy these funtionaities.
