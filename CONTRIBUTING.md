# Getting Started

We are using [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/) as a core front-end framework and [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/getting-started/installation/) as a helper design tool. Clone our repository, install dependencies and start a development server:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/janarosmonaliev/project-416.git
npm install && npm start
```

## Development

### React

Since GatsbyJS utilizes React, please familiarize yourself with [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html). It is an easier way to manage state and refs within components.

### Folder Structure

- `src/components` - React components
- `src/pages` - pages that will be generated
- `src/style.sccs` - global styling with Sass
- `gatsby-config.js` - plugins configuration and site metadata

### Gatsby

Please note that **production build** sometimes might not behave or look as the same as **development build**. Inconsistencies usually arise during HTML builds. Gatsby has a [guideline on debugging these issues](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/debugging-html-builds/).

## Commit messages

Please use an imperatative mood in your commit messages. It is a verb form that makes a command or an instruction. Don't write "React component changed". Write "Change React component".

A proper commit message should complete the following sentence:  
_- If applied, this commit will_ `your message`  
_- If applied, this commit will **Change React component**_  
_- If applied, this commit will **~~React component changed~~**_

## Pull requests, merging and testing

1. Before making a pull request, please make a production build of your code. Script below will run `gatsby clean`, `gatsby build` and `gatsby serve`. It cleans build files and cache, makes a production build and serves it on `localhost:9000`.

```
npm run build-test
```

2. Push your changes and make a pull request. Carefully review the code and wait until `build-test` Github Action finishes checking your code. If there are conflicts, resolve them in your branch by following the steps below:

```bash
(master) git pull origin master  # pulls latest changes from remote
(master) git checkout new-feature  # your branch with conflicts

(new-feature) git pull origin new-feature  # pulls latest changes from remote
(new-feature) git merge master  # merge master into your branch
```

After that, git will prompt you to resolve conflicts by accepting or rejecting changes. Once done, commit merged code and push your changes to the remote.

```bash
(new-feature) git push origin new-feature
```

3. Once conflicts are resolved and code is checked, merge your branch with master. If you encounter some unexpected behavior, or the master branch fails on build - revert your changes:

```bash
(master) git revert --no-commit <commit_hash_oldest> <commit_hash_latest>
(master) git add .
(master) git commit -m "Revert changes"
(master) git push origin master
```

## Latest version

Latest stable production build of the application is automatically published to `gh-pages` branch. It is served at [https://janarosmonaliev.github.io/project-416/](https://janarosmonaliev.github.io/project-416/)

## Issues and bugs

Active issues can be found in [Issues tab](https://github.com/janarosmonaliev/project-416/issues). If you believe that an issue or a bug might interfere with other people's development process, please create a new issue. It must have a short title and a description of the issue. It would be useful to set a flair (`react-bug`, `gatsby-bug`, etc.), include an image and how and where the error can be reproduced.

The person assigned for an issue should try to fix it. However, if a bug occurred due to other developer's changes, team members have to communicate throughly to resolve it together.

Turning on email notifications will help you to be up-to-date with issues and feedbacks.

## General guidelines

Stress test your code's functionality:

1. Do exactly the opposite of what the user is expected to do
2. Check if implemented code works well with other components and does not breaks other features
3. Increase its robustness by checking how it handles unexpected input or data

## Change Log

[@janarosmonaliev](https://github.com/janarosmonaliev) will document important changes to the project on a weekly basis to [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md). If there is no substantial progress made on a particular week, change log will be omitted.

**Format:**

## [version] - yyyy-mm-dd
